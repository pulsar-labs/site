Welcome to Pulsar Labs, an engineering research team working across nano-satellite subsystems, space communication protocols, and robust long-range data transmission pipelines.

We focus on the core components of successful space missions, including specialised nano-satellite operating systems, automated subsystems, secure data transfer protocols and data processing & analysis systems.

Our approach to both research and development is methodical and pragmatic, guided by precision and deep expertise across several domains. We aim for durability, efficiency, forward-thinking design, and of course, cost-effective production.

Please explore our growing collection of work and research, and feel free to contact us with any enquiries you may have.


**Our Mission**

At Pulsar Labs, our mission is simply to create systems that benefit scientific discovery, Earth observation, and telecommunications via space technology. We strive to push the boundaries of what's currently possible, and implement reliable, modern, economical solutions for small space deployments and communications systems.

## Research Focus

Our research areas currently include (but are not limited to):

- **Nano-Satellite Operating Systems** Investigating real-time operating systems (RTOS) and fault-tolerant systems optimised for nano-satellites.
- **Data Transfer Protocols** Designing low-power and secure communication protocols tailored for the space environment.
- **Long-Range Data Transmission** Exploring inter-satellite communication and ground-to-satellite data transmission techniques.

**Commercial Consultation Services**

In addition to our research pursuits, Pulsar Labs offers commercial consultation services tailored to the unique needs of the space sector. We draw upon our extensive expertise in many different technologies to bring benefit to a wide range of industries, including:
